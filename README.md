# User Stories

* As a user, I want to GET and POST reviews about burgers.
* As a user, I want to GET burgers that have `drink_special`s
* As a user, I want to see the most popular burgers by number of reviews or by overall rating.
* As a user, I want to PUT and DELETE reviews, but only if I wrote them. (Start by requiring a user_name param to match the user_name of the author on the message. You can always try authentication later.)
* As a user, I want to look up random burgers just for fun.
